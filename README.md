# Enterprise Network planning and virtual deployment

Project presented in the Network architectures course (Universidade de Aveiro), 2017.

The main goal of the project was to plan and build a big enterprise network in a simulator (GNS3), following business and technical requirements.
Besides regular IPv4 and IpV6 addressing, Vlan's, DNS and other configurations, other advanced features were asked, like
the implementation of QoS policies, multicast, configuration of a VPN server, firewall configuration, DHCP server configuration for IPv4 and IPv6,
defining a budget for all the equipment, among others.
